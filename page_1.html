            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Academic advising is a collaborative process where students work with a qualified UMSI Academic 
            Advisor to envision, implement, and reflect on their academic plans. Students share their goals, challenges, 
            and questions, while the advisor provides expertise on university and program requirements, policies, and 
            procedures. Together, they create an academic plan that supports the student's personal and professional 
            aspirations.</p>
            <h2>Tips For Getting The Most Out Of Advising</h2>
            <p>As academic advisors, we are here for you and want to see you get the most out of your experience in the 
            BSI program. We offer several ways to connect with us, which you can see on our 
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/bsiacademicadvising/academic-advising/connecting-with-an-advisor?authuser=0">Connecting With An Advisor</a>

            <h3>Find the Right Service for You</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scheduled 1:1 Appointments:</strong> These 15- or 30-minute meetings must be scheduled at least 
                24 hours in advance and are ideal for addressing unique or complex questions or concerns. In some cases, 
                your advisor may recommend or require you to schedule an appointment if a question raised via email or 
                during drop-in advising needs more time to address.</li>
                <li><strong>Drop-in 1:1 Advising Appointments:</strong> Offered weekly without pre-registration, drop-in 
                appointments allow students to meet with any available advisor on a first-come, first-served basis. These 
                sessions are best suited for time-sensitive questions that can be resolved in 10 minutes or less.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Communication:</strong> Email provides an effective way to connect with the advising team 
                    asynchronously, especially for students managing busy schedules. It also creates a written record of the 
                    conversation for future reference. The advising team aims to respond to student emails within 24 
                    business hours (Monday–Friday, 9 AM–5 PM, excluding holidays), though response times may vary.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Mark Down the Deadlines</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Students should stay informed about key dates, such as semester start and end dates, add/drop deadlines, 
                and any other deadlines that may impact their experience, like those related to financial aid. For official 
                university deadlines, refer to the <a href="https://ro.umich.edu/calendars?field_calendar_type_target_id%5B1%5D=1&field_calendar_type_target_id%5B2%5D=2&field_term_target_id=178&title=">
                UM Registrar Calendar</a>. </li>
                <li>Plan ahead by scheduling advising appointments well before these deadlines. It's a good idea to allow 
                extra time in case follow-up steps are needed after your appointment.</li>
                <li>If reaching out via email, do so several days before any upcoming deadlines.</li>
                <li>Whenever possible, connect with your advisor proactively—before an issue arises or becomes urgent. 
                While advisors are here to assist during challenges, they must work within the university's guidelines, 
                procedures, and policies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Preparing for Advising Appointments</h3>
            <p>Making the most of your advising appointment begins with proper preparation. Here are some steps to help you get ready:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Know Your Goals:</strong> Identify what you want to achieve during the meeting. Whether it's planning 
                your course schedule, discussing career goals, or addressing a specific challenge, having a clear purpose will 
                help you and your advisor stay focused.</li>
                <li><strong>Review Relevant Information: </strong>Check your degree requirements, course options, and any emails 
                or resources related to your questions. Familiarize yourself with key dates and deadlines, such as add/drop deadlines 
                or graduation requirements, to guide the discussion.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare Questions and Topics: </strong>Write down any specific questions, concerns, or topics you'd like 
                to cover. This ensures you won't forget anything important during the meeting.</li>
                <li><strong>Bring Necessary Materials: </strong>Have any relevant documents, such as your unofficial transcript, 
                degree audit, or a draft course schedule, ready to share.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Open and Honest: </strong>Share your goals, challenges, or uncertainties openly. The more your 
                advisor understands your situation, the better they can guide you.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow Up and Take Action: </strong>After your appointment, review any notes or action items you 
                discussed. Complete any next steps promptly, such as submitting forms, adjusting your schedule, or researching 
                opportunities.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Preparing for your advising appointment not only helps you get the answers you need but also ensures a more 
            productive and efficient conversation.</p>
